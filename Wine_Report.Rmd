```{r}
wine <- read.csv("https://www.math.carleton.edu/ckelling/data/wine_project.csv")
names(wine)
```

Check for covariance
```{r}
ggpairs(wine)
```

fit a basic model and examine VIF
```{r}
basic.wine.lm <- lm(quality ~ fixed.acidity + volatile.acidity + citric.acid + residual.sugar + chlorides + free.sulfur.dioxide + total.sulfur.dioxide + density + pH + sulphates + alcohol + color, data = wine)
vif(basic.wine.lm)
```

Examine t and F tests for basic model
```{r}
anova(basic.wine.lm)
summary(basic.wine.lm)
```
Fit next model iteration
```{r}
wine.lm.one <- lm(quality ~ fixed.acidity + volatile.acidity + residual.sugar + chlorides + total.sulfur.dioxide + density + pH + sulphates + alcohol + color, data = wine)
vif(wine.lm.one)
anova(wine.lm.one)
summary(wine.lm.one)
crp(wine.lm.one)
```
